# Quickstart (Data Write and Read)

Example pseudo code for publishing data associated with a schema (public or private)

## 

Pre-requisites

A typescript environment with [`viem`](https://viem.sh/) and [`@somnia-chain/streams`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@somnia-chain/streams) installed

## 

Steps

### 

1\. Define your schema as a string and plug it into the schema encoder

Copy
    
    
    import { SDK, zeroBytes32, SchemaEncoder } from "@somnia-chain/streams"
    
    const gpsSchema = `uint64 timestamp, int32 latitude, int32 longitude, int32 altitude, uint32 accuracy, bytes32 entityId, uint256 nonce`
    const schemaEncoder = new SchemaEncoder(gpsSchema)

`schemaEncoder` can now be used to encode data for broadcast and also decode data when reading it from Somnia Data Stream SDK.

### 

2\. Compute your unique schema identifier from the schema

Copy
    
    
    const sdk = new SDK({
        public: getPublicClient(),
        wallet: getWalletClient(),
    })
    const schemaId = await sdk.streams.computeSchemaId(gpsSchema)
    console.log(`Schema ID ${schemaId}`)

All data broadcast with the Somnia Data Stream SDK write mechanism must be linked to a schema ID so that we know how to decode the data on read.

### 

3\. Encode the data you want to store that is compatible with the schema

Copy
    
    
    const encodedData: Hex = schemaEncoder.encodeData([
        { name: "timestamp", value: Date.now().toString(), type: "uint64" },
        { name: "latitude", value: "51509865", type: "int32" },
        { name: "longitude", value: "-0118092", type: "int32" },
        { name: "altitude", value: "0", type: "int32" },
        { name: "accuracy", value: "0", type: "uint32" },
        { name: "entityId", value: zeroBytes32, type: "bytes32" }, // object providing GPS data
        { name: "nonce", value: "0", type: "uint256" },
    ])

The value returned is a raw hex encoded bytes value that can be broadcast on-chain via the Somnia Data Stream SDK. 

### 

4\. Publish data (with our without a public schema)

Copy
    
    
    const publishTxHash = await sdk.streams.set([{
        id: toHex("london", { size: 32 }),
        schemaId: computedGpsSchemaId,
        data: encodedData,
    }])

`set` has the following parameter `dataStreams` which is a list of data points being written to chain `dataStreams` has the `DataStream[]` type:

Copy
    
    
    type Hex = `0x{string}`
    type DataStream = {
        id: Hex // Unique data key for the publisher
        schemaId: Hex // Computed from the raw schema string
        data: Hex // From step 3, raw bytes data formated as a hex string
    }

### 

5\. Direct data read without reactivity

Copy
    
    
    const data = await sdk.streams.getByKey(
      computedGpsSchemaId,
      publisherWalletAddress,
      dataKey
    )

This last step shows how you request data from Somnia data streams filtering on:

  1. Schema ID

  2. Address of the account that wrote the data to chain

     1. This could be an EOA or another smart contract




The response from `getByKey` will be the data published but decoded for the specified schema. 

Note: where the schema ID is associated with a public data schema that has been registered on-chain, the SDK will automatically decode the raw data published on-chain and return that decoded data removing the need for the decoder. If the schema is not public, the schema decoder will be required outside of the SDK and you will instead get raw bytes from the chain. Example:

Copy
    
    
    if (data) {
      schemaEncoder.decode(data)
    }

Further filters can be applied client side to the data in order to filter for specifics within the data. GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
