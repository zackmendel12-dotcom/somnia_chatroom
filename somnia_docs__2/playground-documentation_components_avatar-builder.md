The avatar creator allows you to create a custom avatar to be used across the Somnia network. This avatar is created using MML making it interoperable across experiences.

The avatar builder will be extended in the future with more customisation options. We will also enable creators to make their own assets to customise the avatar.

You can build your first avatar using this [guide here](/playground-documentation/getting-started/create-your-first-avatar).
