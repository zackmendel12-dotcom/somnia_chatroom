# Somnia-Mission

To enable mass consumer real-time applications to be built at web2 scale with web3 properties, creating a more open, equitable internet.

### 

Key Objectives

  * Applications that can scale to web2 usage levels (millions of CCU, 100,000’s of transactions per second)

  * Open censorship-resistant systems accessible to anyone with access to the internet

  * No one counterparty controlling and hoarding value

  * Composable systems where value is shared among the participants

  * Free movement of people and assets between platforms so creators and users have freedom of choice




A more open and equitable world.

### 

Core Principles 

#### 

On-Chain Experiences

We are committed to building technology to make fully on-chain, real-time mass-scale applications possible and practical. We believe this is essential for creating a composable, open internet.

#### 

Multiverse over Monolith

We believe in a collection of applications, each with distinct, interconnected experiences, much like countries within a global community, sharing utilities that enhance mutual growth.

#### 

Empowering Composability

Central to our vision is the principle of composability—the ability for builders to build upon each other’s work, creating a culture of collaboration in which the collective output surpasses the sum of its parts. 

#### 

Builder Empowerment

We will empower builders with the freedom to build sustainable models of engagement and ownership. This includes safeguarding the rights to digital assets and creating an environment where innovation is not stifled by platform constraints.

#### 

Accessibility for All

The promise of the virtual society is in its potential for universal access, removing barriers for content creation and participation. Leveling the playing field such that anyone with an internet connection can participate and succeed.
