# How To Guides

Welcome to the **How-To Guides** — your one-stop resource for building on the **Somnia Network**.

This section is designed to help developers of all experience levels onboard quickly, understand the tools available to them, and start shipping powerful dApps on Somnia.

Somnia offers a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain with blazing-fast finality, high throughput, and robust developer tooling. Whether you're deploying your first smart contract, building out a full-stack decentralized application, or integrating advanced tooling like oracles, subgraphs, and SDKs — you're in the right place.

Our guides are **practical, up-to-date, and hands-on** , focused on real implementations that will help you go from zero to deployed faster than ever.

**Developers who are deploying Smart Contracts and need Somnia Test Tokens, STT. Please join the**[**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/somnia)**. Go to the #dev-chat channel, tag the Somnia DevRel,**`**@emma_odia**`**and request Test Tokens. You can also email**`**[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**`**with a brief description of what you are building and your GitHub profile.**
