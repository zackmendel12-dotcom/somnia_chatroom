# Create your first world

First, go to https://playground.somnia.network/. Here, you can start your journey to create your own slice of the metaverse.

### 

Connecting Your Wallet

You need to do is connect your wallet. There are two different ways to do this on the Playground interface. You can see those options in the screenshot below.

You will then need to make a few confirmations in your wallet.

### 

Navigating Worlds

The globe icon at the top of the screen allows you to navigate to the different worlds available. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-13.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=3e334003&sv=2)

When you click any of the “select” buttons in the menu on the right side of your screen, the dashboard will transform into a preview of the world you have chosen. Note: sometimes, the select button will say “Jump in,” but it has the same effect. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-11.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9e304de9&sv=2)

When you have chosen the world that you want, click the “Jump In” button at the bottom of the screen to explore the world with your avatar. You should see a short loading screen. Then, you will be able to navigate the world you selected!

### 

Avatars

Now, let’s talk about avatars. The icon showing two human figures allows you to access your avatars. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-16.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=478f0f5e&sv=2)

You can also access the worlds and avatars on the left side of your screen

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-10.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=60f5b850&sv=2)

You will start out with a default avatar, but if you want something more personalized, you can visit the Somnia [Metaverse browser](https://betanet.somnia.network/metaverse-browser) to mint a personalized avatar for free! When you go to the Metaverse Browser, select the avatar icon on the left side of the screen, and start personalizing your avatar. You can also go directly to Somnia’s [Avatar Builder](https://avatar-v2.somnia.network/).

Also, make sure to connect with the same wallet that you plan to use for the Playground, so you will be able to use your avatar there. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-4.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=b32f25cf&sv=2)

Personalize your avatar by giving it a name, you can give the avatar your name, or create an alter ego! Click on “Avatar Name,” enter the name you want, and then click “save.”

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-12.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=cc8432fa&sv=2)

When you save the name of your avatar you should see this loading screen before reappearing back in your Playground. This screen will also appear jumping into a new world. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-2.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=fbd10b51&sv=2)

### 

Movement

Now let’s discuss movement

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-14.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=d6361a24&sv=2)

The “i” with a circle around it is the information button that shows you how to move. You can navigate your angle of vision using the mouse, and then use the following keys to move:

W – Forward

A – Left

S – Backward

D – Right

Space – Jump

Shift – Run

### 

Create Your Own World

You can also create your own world! Just click the create world button at the bottom of your screen. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-7.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=a797e8cc&sv=2)

Next, a screen will pop up asking you to name your world. Choose a name, and then click “Create World.”

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-8.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9908383&sv=2)

After your world is created, you will get another pop up with a button for visiting the world, and then another button to copy the world’s URL so you can invite your friends. 

![](https://docs.somnia.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsomnia.network%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2Fimage-15.png&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=e4d5c88d&sv=2)

You can share any world that you visit with your friends and invite them to join you, even for worlds that you didn’t create. Click on the “share” icon as shown below to choose what world you want to share:
