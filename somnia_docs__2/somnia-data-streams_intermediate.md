# Data Provenance and Verification in Streams

When consuming data from any source, especially in a decentralized environment, the most critical question is: **"Can I trust this data?"**

This question is not just about the data's content, but its _origin_. How do you know that data claiming to be from a trusted oracle, a specific device, or another user _actually_ came from them and not from an imposter?

This is the challenge of **Data Provenance**.

In Somnia Data Streams, provenance is not an optional feature or a "best practice". It is a fundamental, cryptographic guarantee built into the core smart contract. This article explains how Streams ensures authenticity via publisher signatures and how you can verify data origin.

## 

The Cryptographic Guarantee: `msg.sender` as Provenance

The trust layer of Somnia Streams is elegantly simple. It does not rely on complex off-chain signature checking or data fields like `senderName`. Instead, it leverages the most basic and secure primitive of the EVM: `msg.sender`.

All data published to Streams is stored in the core `Streams` smart contract. The data storage mapping has a specific structure:

#### 

**Conceptual Contract Storage**

Copy
    
    
    // mapping: schemaId => publisherAddress => dataId => data
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bytes))) public dsstore;

When a publisher calls `sdk.streams.set(...)` or `sdk.streams.setAndEmitEvents(...)`, their wallet signs a transaction. The `Streams` smart contract receives this transaction and identifies the signer's address via the `msg.sender` variable.

The contract then stores the data _at the_` _msg.sender_` _'s address_ within the schema's mapping.

**This is the cryptographic guarantee.**

It is **impossible** for `0xPublisher_A` to send a transaction that writes data into the slot for `0xPublisher_B`. They cannot fake their `msg.sender`. The data is automatically and immutably tied to the address of the account that paid the gas to publish it.

  * An attacker **cannot** write data as if it came from a trusted oracle.

  * A user **cannot** send a chat message pretending to be another user.

  * Data integrity is linked directly to wallet security.




## 

Verification Is Implicit in the Read Operation

Because the `publisher` address is a fundamental key in the storage mapping, you don't need to perform complex "verification" steps. **Verification is implicit in the read operation.**

When you use the SDK to read data, you must specify which publisher you are interested in:

  * `sdk.streams.getByKey(schemaId, publisher, key)`

  * `sdk.streams.getAllPublisherDataForSchema(schemaId, publisher)`




When you call `getAllPublisherDataForSchema(schemaId, '0xTRUSTED_ORACLE_ADDRESS')`, you are not _filtering_ data. You are asking the smart contract to retrieve data from the specific storage slot that _only_ `0xTRUSTED_ORACLE_ADDRESS` could have written to.

If an imposter (`0xIMPOSTER_ADDRESS`) publishes data using the same `schemaId`, their data is stored in a completely different location (`dsstore[schemaId]['0xIMPOSTER_ADDRESS']`). It will never be returned when you query for the trusted address.

## 

Deliverable: Building a Verification Script

Let's build a utility to prove this concept.

**Scenario:** We have a shared `oraclePrice` schema. Two different, trusted oracles (`0xOracle_A` and `0xOracle_B`) publish prices to it. We will build a script that verifies the origin of data and proves that an `imposter` cannot pollute their feeds.

### 

**Project Setup**

We will use the same project setup as the "[Multi-Publisher Aggregator](https://emre-gitbook.gitbook.io/emre-gitbook-docs/data-streams/working-with-multiple-publishers-in-a-shared-stream#tutorial-building-a-multi-publisher-aggregator-app)" tutorial. You will need a `.env` file with at least one private key to act as a publisher, and we will simulate the other addresses.

[`**src/lib/clients.ts**`](https://emre-gitbook.gitbook.io/emre-gitbook-docs/data-streams/working-with-multiple-publishers-in-a-shared-stream#chain-and-client-configuration) (No changes needed from the previous tutorial. We just need `publicClient`.)

`**src/lib/schema.ts**`

Copy
    
    
    export const oraclePriceSchema = 'uint256 price, uint64 timestamp'

### 

**The Verification Script**

This script will not publish data. We will assume our two trusted oracles (`PUBLISHER_1_PK` and `PUBLISHER_2_PK` from the previous tutorial) have already published data using the `oraclePriceSchema`.

Our script will:

  1. Define a list of `TRUSTED_ORACLES`.

  2. Define an `IMPOSTER_ORACLE` (a random address that has _not_ published).

  3. Create a `verifyPublisher` function that fetches data _only_ for a specific publisher address.

  4. Run verification for all addresses and show that data is only returned for the correct publishers.




`**src/scripts/verifyOrigin.ts**`

Copy
    
    
    import 'dotenv/config'
    import { SDK, SchemaDecodedItem } from '@somnia-chain/streams'
    import { publicClient } from '../lib/clients' // Assuming you have clients.ts from previous tutorial
    import { oraclePriceSchema } from '../lib/schema'
    import { Address, createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
    import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
    
    // --- Setup: Define our trusted and untrusted addresses ---
    
    function getEnv(key: string): string {
      const value = process.env[key]
      if (!value) throw new Error(`Missing environment variable: ${key}`)
      return value
    }
    
    // These are the addresses we trust for this schema.
    // We get them from our .env file for this example.
    const TRUSTED_ORACLES: Address[] = [
      privateKeyToAccount(getEnv('PUBLISHER_1_PK') as `0x${string}`).address,
      privateKeyToAccount(getEnv('PUBLISHER_2_PK') as `0x${string}`).address,
    ]
    
    // This is a random, untrusted address.
    const IMPOSTER_ORACLE: Address = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'
    
    // --- Helper Functions ---
    
    // Helper to decode the oracle data
    function decodePriceRecord(row: SchemaDecodedItem[]): { price: bigint, timestamp: number } {
      const val = (field: any) => field?.value?.value ?? field?.value ?? ''
      return {
        price: BigInt(val(row[0])),
        timestamp: Number(val(r[1])),
      }
    }
    
    /**
     * Verification Utility
     * Fetches data for a *single* publisher to verify its origin.
     */
    async function verifyPublisher(sdk: SDK, schemaId: `0x${string}`, publisherAddress: Address) {
      console.log(`\n--- Verifying Publisher: ${publisherAddress} ---`)
      
      try {
        const data = await sdk.streams.getAllPublisherDataForSchema(schemaId, publisherAddress)
        
        if (!data || data.length === 0) {
          console.log('[VERIFIED] No data found for this publisher.')
          return
        }
    
        const records = (data as SchemaDecodedItem[][]).map(decodePriceRecord)
        console.log(`[VERIFIED] Found ${records.length} record(s) cryptographically signed by this publisher:`)
        
        records.forEach(record => {
          console.log(`  - Price: ${record.price}, Time: ${new Date(record.timestamp).toISOString()}`)
        })
    
      } catch (error: any) {
        console.error(`Error during verification: ${error.message}`)
      }
    }
    
    // --- Main Execution ---
    
    async function main() {
      const sdk = new SDK({ public: publicClient })
      
      const schemaId = await sdk.streams.computeSchemaId(oraclePriceSchema)
      if (!schemaId) throw new Error('Could not compute schemaId')
    
      console.log('Starting Data Provenance Verification...')
      console.log(`Schema: oraclePriceSchema (${schemaId})`)
    
      // 1. Verify our trusted oracles
      for (const oracleAddress of TRUSTED_ORACLES) {
        await verifyPublisher(sdk, schemaId, oracleAddress)
      }
    
      // 2. Verify the imposter
      // This will securely return NO data, even if the imposter
      // published data to the same schemaId under their *own* address.
      await verifyPublisher(sdk, schemaId, IMPOSTER_ORACLE)
    }
    
    main().catch((e) => {
      console.error(e)
      process.exit(1)
    })

### 

**Expected Output**

To run this, first publish some data (using the script from the previous tutorial, but adapted for `oraclePriceSchema`) from both `PUBLISHER_1_PK` and `PUBLISHER_2_PK`. Then, run the verification script.

Copy
    
    
    # Add to package.json
    "verify": "ts-node src/scripts/verifyOrigin.ts"
    
    # Run it
    npm run verify

You will see an output similar to this:

Copy
    
    
    Starting Data Provenance Verification...
    Schema: oraclePriceSchema (0x...)
    
    --- Verifying Publisher: 0xPublisher1Address... ---
    [VERIFIED] Found 2 record(s) cryptographically signed by this publisher:
      - Price: 3200, Time: 2025-10-31T12:30:00.000Z
      - Price: 3201, Time: 2025-10-31T12:31:00.000Z
    
    --- Verifying Publisher: 0xPublisher2Address... ---
    [VERIFIED] Found 1 record(s) cryptographically signed by this publisher:
      - Price: 3199, Time: 2025-10-31T12:30:30.000Z
    
    --- Verifying Publisher: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 ---
    [VERIFIED] No data found for this publisher.

## 

Conclusion: Key Takeaways

  * **Provenance is Built-In:** Data provenance in Somnia Streams is not an optional feature; it is a core cryptographic guarantee of the `Streams` smart contract, enforced by `msg.sender`.

  * **Verification is Implicit:** You verify data origin every time you perform a read operation with `getAllPublisherDataForSchema` or `getByKey`. The `publisher` address acts as the ultimate verification key.

  * **Trust Layer:** This architecture creates a robust trust layer. Your application logic can be certain that any data returned for a specific publisher was, without question, signed and submitted by that publisher's wallet.
