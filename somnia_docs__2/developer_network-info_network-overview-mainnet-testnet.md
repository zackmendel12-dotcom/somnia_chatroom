# Network Overview (Mainnet / Testnet)

Somnia provides two distinct environments for developers and users: **Mainnet** and **Testnet (Shannon)**. Both serve different purposes in the ecosystem, and knowing when to use which is essential for building and deploying applications effectively.

* * *

### 

Somnia Mainnet

The **Mainnet** is the official production blockchain of Somnia. All transactions on this chain are **final and irreversible** and require **SOMI tokens** as gas.

#### 

Key Characteristics

  * Real-value environment secured by Somnia’s validator set.

  * Integrated with wallets, explorers, bridges, and infrastructure providers.

  * Permanent and immutable transaction history.

  * Designed for live dApps, end-users, and production-ready deployments.




#### 

When to Use Mainnet

  * Deploying **audited and tested smart contracts**.

  * Running dApps with **real users and assets**.

  * Managing liquidity, staking, governance, or NFT projects.

  * Partner integrations requiring **security and finality**.




#### 

Example

Deploy to Somnia Mainnet

Copy
    
    
    # Deploying a contract to Somnia Mainnet
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network somnia_mainnet

* * *

### 

Somnia Testnet (Shannon)

The **Testnet** is a sandbox environment that mirrors mainnet behavior but uses **STT test tokens** with no real-world value. It allows safe experimentation and rapid iteration without financial risk.

#### 

Key Characteristics

  * Transactions use **STT tokens** , available via the faucet.

  * Close-to-mainnet parameters for realistic testing.

  * Safe for prototyping, debugging, and QA.

  * Commonly used in workshops, hackathons, and developer onboarding.




#### 

When to Use Testnet

  * Learning how to connect and deploy on Somnia.

  * Prototyping features or building MVPs.

  * Debugging smart contracts or dApp flows.

  * Preparing for audits and production deployment.




#### 

Example

Deploy to Somnia Testnet (Shannon)

Copy
    
    
    # Deploying a contract to Somnia Testnet
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network somnia_testnet

### 

Best Practices

  * Start on Testnet: Validate contracts and flows on Shannon before mainnet.

  * Audit before launch: Ensure contracts are reviewed and secure.

  * Use separate configs: Keep `.env` files distinct for testnet and mainnet.

  * Stay updated: Follow official announcements for upgrades and changes.




Tip: Treat **Testnet** as your safe playground and **Mainnet** as your production stage. Every project should pass through Testnet before moving to Mainnet.
