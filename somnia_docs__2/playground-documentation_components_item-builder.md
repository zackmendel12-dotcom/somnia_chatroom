# Item Builder

The item builder allows you to create custom items to be used across the Somnia network. The first place you can use the items is in the Playground.

You can find the item builder here -> <https://items-builder.somnia.network/>[](https://items-builder.somnia.network/)

Once you get to that page you can click the item builder button to bring up the tool: [ ](https://items-builder.somnia.network/build)

The tool allows you to create custom static objects by uploading a GLB file. A guide on how to use it can be [found here](/playground-documentation/getting-started/create-your-first-object).
