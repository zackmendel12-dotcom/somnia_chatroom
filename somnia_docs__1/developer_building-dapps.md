# Tokens and NFTs

Tokens and NFTs form the backbone of value and ownership on Somnia. This section walks you through how to **create, deploy, and interact** with ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 contracts on the Somnia Network.

You’ll learn how to:

  * Deploy fungible tokens (ERC-20) and configure supply and minting logic

  * Create and manage NFTs (ERC-721 / ERC-1155) for digital assets and collectibles

  * Integrate token interactions into your dApps and subgraphs

  * Understand token standards and best practices for gas optimization




> Whether you’re launching a governance token, building an NFT marketplace, or gamifying user engagement, Somnia’s speed and scalability make asset creation seamless.
