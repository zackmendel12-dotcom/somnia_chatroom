Unlock Schedule 

The SOMI token unlock schedule chart below illustrates the gradual release of tokens over a period of 48 months post-launch. The circulating supply is segmented into five categories, each contributing to the overall supply incrementally:

Community (Light blue): The largest allocation, represented by the light area. This will be used for community initiatives, including liquidity and airdrops. This will have 10.945% unlocked a TGE then a increased unlock at M1 and M2, then monthly vesting linear for 36 months.

Ecosystem (Orange): The ecosystem allocation, depicted in orange, reflects the gradual and consistent release of tokens intended to fuel ecosystem development and partnerships. This allocation has linear linear 48 months vesting. 5.075% will be unlocked at TGE

Investors (Yellow): Represented by the yellow area, investor tokens start release at month 12 and vest monthly afterwards for 36 months.

Advisors (Green): Key advisors to the project have a 12-month cliff with a 36-month linear vest.

Launch Partners (Red): The red area illustrates the allocation for launch partners. This allocation has a 12-month cliff with a 48-month linear vest. These are allocated to early contributors to the Somnia ecosystem (eg Improbable).

Team (Blue): The team allocation is shown in blue. This has a 12-month cliff with a 48-month linear vest. This gradual increase ensures alignment with the project's long-term goals and incentivizes sustained contribution.

The chart demonstrates the planned and strategic distribution of SOMI tokens, ensuring balanced growth and support for various stakeholders in the ecosystem.
