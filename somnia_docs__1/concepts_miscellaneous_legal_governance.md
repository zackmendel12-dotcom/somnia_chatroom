# Governance

This section outlines our current centralized governance framework, which will transition to a decentralized governance model as the network evolves.

**Corporate Framework:** Somnia operates through a Cayman Islands Foundation structure with British Virgin Islands subsidiary entities. This structure ensures regulatory compliance and operational efficiency across jurisdictions.

**Board of Directors:** Four-member Board of Directors provides strategic oversight and holds primary decision-making authority over key business and financial matters. The Board meets quarterly to ensure effective governance and strategic direction.

**Supervision:** A Cayman-based legal Supervisor provides independent oversight to the Board of Directors, ensuring governance best practices and regulatory compliance.

**Corporate Administration:** Professional corporate secretarial services maintain all corporate records and facilitate Board meetings in accordance with regulatory requirements.

**Compliance:** All entities within our structure maintain comprehensive AML/CFT compliance programs, ensuring adherence to applicable international standards and regulatory frameworks across all jurisdictions of operation.
