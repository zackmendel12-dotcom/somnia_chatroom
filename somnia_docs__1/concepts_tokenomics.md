Token Utility

SOMI is a delegated proof of stake token (dPoS) it is intended for:

  * Staking functions

    * Validator staking - To provide validator nodes for the Somnia blockchain, Tokens must be staked.

    * Delegated staking - Tokens can be delegated to Node Providers to cover their staking costs.

  * Payment methods

    * Gas Fees - To use the blockchain, gas fees will be paid in the SOMI token.

  * Governance: The Token will eventually be used to inform how decisions regarding the Network and its components are made. The details of this are to be determined.
