# OnRamps

OnRamps make it easy for users to move from the traditional financial system into the Somnia ecosystem by purchasing tokens directly with their local currency.

This section covers how to integrate **Banxa** , Somnia’s trusted onramping service, to enable seamless and secure fiat-to-crypto transactions within your dApps.

You’ll learn how to:

  * Embed Banxa’s checkout flow in your application

  * Support multiple payment methods (credit/debit card, bank transfer, etc.)

  * Customize the onramp experience to match your app’s branding

  * Streamline user onboarding with a direct path from fiat to onchain activity




> Banxa provides developers and users with a regulated, global, and developer-friendly solution for accessing the Somnia network — making your application more inclusive and easier to adopt.
