  1. **Go to the** [**Tokos App**](https://app.tokos.fi/)**:** Connect your wallet to the Tokos lending platform.

  2. **Select an Asset:** Choose the digital asset you wish to supply from the list of available markets.

  3. **Enter Amount:** Specify the amount of the asset you want to supply to the liquidity pool.

  4. **Approve & Supply:** First, approve the Tokos smart contract to spend your tokens, then submit the supply transaction.

  5. **Start Earning:** Once your transaction is confirmed, you will start earning interest on your supplied assets. You will receive a corresponding amount of aTokens (e.g., aUSDC), which represent your share in the pool and accrue interest in real-time.

  1. **Supply Collateral:** Before you can borrow, you must supply assets to be used as collateral.

  2. **Enable as Collateral:** In your supply dashboard, make sure the asset you want to use as collateral is enabled.

  3. **Choose Asset to Borrow:** Select the asset you wish to borrow from the "Borrow" section.

  4. **Specify Amount:** Enter the amount you want to borrow. The interface will show your "Health Factor," which indicates the safety of your loan. A lower Health Factor increases your risk of liquidation.

  5. **Confirm Transaction:** Submit the borrow transaction. The borrowed assets will be transferred to your wallet.

2\. For Developers

Tokos provides a base layer for developers to build their own DeFi applications. By interacting with the protocol's smart contracts, you can integrate borrowing/lending functions into your own platforms. You can access the Tokos smart contracts via the [link](https://docs.tokos.fi/deployed-contracts).
