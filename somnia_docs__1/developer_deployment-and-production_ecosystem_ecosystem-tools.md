# Ecosystem Tools

Somnia is built with a robust ecosystem of infrastructure providers that enable developers, projects, and businesses to integrate seamlessly with the network. 

With Somnia's ecosystem of infrastructure partners, developers have access to scalable RPCs, smart contract tools, oracles, account abstraction, identity solutions, and analytics. 

Each partner provides critical tooling, APIs, and services to power decentralized applications (dApps) on Somnia. Below is an overview of our key Infrastructure Partners and resources to get started.

**Developers who are deploying Smart Contracts and need Somnia Test Tokens, STT. Please join the**[**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/somnia)**. Go to the #dev-chat channel, tag the Somnia DevRel,**`**@emma_odia**`**and request Test Tokens. You can also email**`**[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**`**with a brief description of what you are building and your GitHub profile.**
