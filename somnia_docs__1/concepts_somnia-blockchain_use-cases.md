# Use Cases

## 

**Gaming - Fully On-Chain, Forever Evolving Games**

Somnia enables fully on-chain games where creators can easily build, modify, and extend games. Developers can create games that live forever on-chain, allowing players to own their in-game assets, modding systems, and worlds that grow continuously without centralized control.

## 

**SocialFi - True Ownership for Social Media Accounts**

Somnia powers full on-chain social media platforms where users own their accounts and data. Creators aren’t locked into one platform and can freely port their content and followers between ecosystems, ensuring freedom and control.

## 

**Metaverse - Building Interoperable Virtual Socieities**

Somnia is the backbone for metaverse applications where entire economies and ecosystems are built with on-chain ownership and logic. Developers can create worlds with seamless interoperability, allowing assets, avatars, and experiences to cross over between multiple virtual environments.

## 

**DeFi - Fully On-Chain Limit Order Books (LOBs)**

Somnia’s performance enables fully on-chain limit order books (LOBs), offering price discovery and order matching similar to centralized exchanges but with full transparency and self-custody. This innovation brings more efficiency and fairness to decentralized finance (DeFi).

## 

**Real-Time Applications - Powering Real-Time, Large-Scale Applications**

Somnia’s ultra-fast processing and sub-second finality are designed for real-time, mass-consumer applications. This goes beyond the categories above to places we have not imagined, Ultimately any web2 style application can now be built on web3 rails, offering the best of both worlds. We don’t even know all the possibilities yet and would love for builders to help us discover what is now possible when limits are removed.
