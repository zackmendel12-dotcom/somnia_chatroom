# Data Indexing and Querying

Subgraphs allow your dApp to efficiently index and query onchain data from the Somnia Network. Whether you're building dashboards, tracking events, or querying user actions, Subgraphs provide a scalable way to make your smart contract data accessible and searchable.

In this section, you’ll learn:

  * [How to create and deploy subgraphs on Somnia using **ORMI**](/developer/building-dapps/data-indexing-and-querying/ormi-subgraph)

  * [How to build with **Protofire’s subgraph infrastructure**](/developer/building-dapps/data-indexing-and-querying/protofire-subgraph)

  * [Frontend integrations for building responsive UIs from your subgraph data](/developer/building-dapps/data-indexing-and-querying/building-subgraph-uis-nextjs-fetch)




> Subgraphs are essential for any developer building real-time dApps, analytics dashboards, or event-driven logic on Somnia.
