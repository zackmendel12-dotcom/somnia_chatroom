# Example Applications

This section showcases **hands-on examples** of real applications built on Somnia, from small experimental dApps to full scale and production ready projects.

Each example walks you through architecture, deployment, and integration patterns, helping you understand **how all the pieces fit together:** contracts, subgraphs, oracles, APIs, and SDKs.

You’ll find examples like:

  * Token swap dApps (DEX)

  * DAO Smart Contract

  * DAO User Interface




> These examples are meant to inspire and guide you. Use them as blueprints, remix them, or extend them — and build the next great dApp on Somnia.
