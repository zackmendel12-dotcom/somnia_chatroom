# Oracles

Oracles bridge the gap between onchain and offchain worlds. They bring external data like prices, randomness, and real-world events directly into your smart contracts.

In this section, you’ll explore:

  * [How to integrate **DIA price feeds** on Somnia](/developer/building-dapps/oracles/dia-price-feeds)

  * [How to implement **Protofire Price Feeds**](/developer/building-dapps/oracles/protofire-price-feeds)

  * [How to implement **Verifiable Randomness (VRF)** via **Protofire + Chainlink**](/developer/building-dapps/oracles/using-verifiable-randomness-vrf)

  * Use cases for oracles in DeFi, gaming, prediction markets, and more




> If your dApp depends on real-world data, randomness, or secure external inputs — this is where to start.
