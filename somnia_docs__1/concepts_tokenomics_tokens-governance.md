# Tokens Governance

The Somnia governance is still in it’s early phases and will evolve as the project evolves. This document outlines our current thinking.

## 

Somnia Token Governance Overview

The Somnia governance system has 5 different groups:

  * Token house - Token owners that primarily govern allocation of foundation and community tokens

  * Validator council - Validators in control of hard forks, gas economics and network upgrades.

  * Developer council - Key developers that oversee the technology roadmap

  * User assembly - Key users who are used as a check and balance to other groups 

  * Foundation board - Initially in control of the treasury and deployment of new code to the network. Eventually used as a conduit for the other participants and emergency overrides.

Token house processes

The token house primarily looks over allocation of the foundation's funds. This is done via proposals. Proposals can be created by any token owner. They are then approved by a majority vote of other token holders.

During the bootstrap phase, the token house will be able to propose new allocation of foundation funds. This could include:

  * Allocation of grants to new project

  * Allocation of community tokens to new incentive program

  * Allocation of budget for new marketing program for the year




During the Transition phase, token holders will be able to vote on proposals. The foundation board will still have the ultimate decision on allocating funds.

During the mature phase the token holders will have the ability to propose and approve allocation of funds. This can be vetoed by the user assembly or foundation board in extreme cases. In general, the board should enact the token holders approved proposals.

Overview

Bootstrap

0–6 months post‑mainnet

Foundation board in control. Other groups formed without any control.

Transition

6–24 months

Introduction of all governance groups. Beginning of proposal process. Ultimate control still with foundation.
