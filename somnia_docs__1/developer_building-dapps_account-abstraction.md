# Account Abstraction

Account Abstraction (AA) revolutionizes how users interact with blockchain applications by making wallets **smarter, simpler, and more programmable**.

In this section, you’ll explore how to implement **Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs)** on Somnia using modern tooling like **Thirdweb** and **Privy** , and learn how to enable **gasless transactions** and **session keys** for better UX.

You’ll learn how to:

  * Create and manage smart contract wallets

  * Implement user operations via ERC-4337-style flows

  * Enable sponsored and gasless transactions

  * Simplify onboarding through smart wallets and relayers




> Account Abstraction bridges the gap between Web2 simplicity and Web3 ownership — empowering developers to build dApps users actually love to use.
