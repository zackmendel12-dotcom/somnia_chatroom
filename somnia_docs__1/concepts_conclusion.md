# 🌑Conclusion

We believe in the vision of a world computer. A world where computing is accessible and usable by anyone with an internet connection, where data is shared across a global network that enables composable and interoperable applications. Ethereum started this movement and has provided the backbone for finance. We want to carry that flag for all application classes that can scale and compete with the large-scale web2 market while giving users and builders freedom, ownership and agency. A free and open internet.
