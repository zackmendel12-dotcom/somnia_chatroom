Somnia is a high-performance, cost-efficient EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain capable of processing over 1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality. It is suitable for serving millions of users and building real-time mass-consumer applications like games, social applications, metaverses, and more, all fully on-chain.

The Somnia blockchain has achieved 1.05m TPS (ERC-20 swaps) running over 100 nodes distributed globally. During these benchmarks Somnia also achieved 50k uniswaps per second (across one pool) and 300k NFT mints per seconds (one NFT contract). These workloads we do not believe would be achievable by parallel EVM approaches.

Somnia has four key innovations in blockchain architecture to achieve this performance level:

  * [Accelerated Sequential Execution](/concepts/somnia-blockchain/accelerated-sequential-execution) \- through compiled EVM bytecode.

  * [IceDB](/concepts/somnia-blockchain/somnias-icedb) \- a faster, more predictable database for storing blockchain state.

  * [MultiStream consensus](/concepts/somnia-blockchain/multistream-consensus) \- a proof-of-stake, partially synchronous BFT protocol inspired by [Autobahn BFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10369).

  * [Advanced compression techniques](/concepts/somnia-blockchain/advanced-compression-techniques) \- to deal with increased node-to-node data traffic due to the throughput.




Somnia is supported by [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io/) and [MSquared](https://msquared.io/). Improbable will develop some of the key technical components of Somnia, including the Blockchain, but the project will require a large and active community to fulfil its vision.

The Somnia token SOMI is issued by the Somnia Token Co Ltd.
